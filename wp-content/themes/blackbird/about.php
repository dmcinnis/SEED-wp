            <p>SEED aims to provide growing social enterprises the support they need to achieve new levels of performance by pairing them with increasing student interest and the most up-to-date business tools and techniques.</p>
            <img class="aligncenter"  src="http://i.imgur.com/H00RDsh.gif" />
            <p>SEED was formed in 2008 by a group of passionate students committed to fostering sustainable development in communities around the world. Inspired by Muhammad Yunus, the father of microfinance, this group of students hoped to use their skills in finance, marketing and management to bring change to developing communities around the world.</p>
            <p>By developing a partnership with the McIntire School of Commerce (Rated #1 Business school by Business Week for 2009), SEED was able to utilize the full resources offered to them, while still maintaining the UVA motto of student self-governance. Thus SEED grew from a small group to one of the largest organizations under the McIntire School umbrella.</p>
            <p>With over 250+ members working on projects for NGOs around the world, SEED has now established itself in the University of Virginia community, attracting members from all schools and disciplines within the University. As SEED looks to the future, the focus still remains on the vision that was formed by the founding members.</p>

            <p>SEED is a passionate group of students committed to fostering sustainable development in communities around the world. We do this by giving free consulting services to NGOs and social entrepreneurs wherever they need us, with an emphasis on sound microfinance. By forging long-term relationships, we are able to increase the efficacy and efficiency of our partners, and intensify the positive social change in their communities.</p>
            <p>We also seek educational and personal development within the University of Virginia. Through working in teams to solve problems for our partners, students are able to broaden their knowledge horizons while actively practicing the skills they learn in class.</p>

            <p>In short, our objectives are to:<p>
            <ol>
              <li>Provide support for small and start-up NGOs and social entrepreneurs that can potentially have a greater impact on their local communities,</li>
              <li>Facilitate the growth of motivated social entrepreneurs within the UVA community, and;</li>
              <li>Provide a channel for students to adopt a hands-on approach to learning while serving the community.</li>
            </ol>
